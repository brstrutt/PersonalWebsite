      <h1>Where Am I?</h1>
      <p>You are on a website. You are on MY website. This site is just an excuse to learn how to put together a website from scratch.</p>
      <p>It's got all kinds of nonsense, mainly focused on things I've done. Some is just pictures of nerd shit, the rest is gonna be paragraphs on the dumb things I've tried and how I did them.</p>
      <p>If you like asking questions such as "Why would you do that?" and "Isn't that just making things more complicated?" then you've come to the right place.</p>
      <p>(Also if you like asking "why is this site mostly kinda crappy drawings of maps?", it's because I needed SOMETHING on the site to test the backend).</p>
      <h1>Who Are You?</h1>
      <p>I am Ben</p>
      <p>Howdy</p>
      <p>I do programming and other nerd stuff that'll probably end up on here at some point.</p>
      <p>Specific categories of things I do should be found in the Sidebar....assuming I made it right...and assuming I've actually put stuff on the site.</p>
      <h1>WHAT YEAR IS IT?</h1>
      <p>2022 I guess. Year of the Tiger I hear.</p>
      <!TODO: Grab and display the current year in various different calendars for fun/>
