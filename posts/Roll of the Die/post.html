	<p>This is a game produced during GMTK Game Jam 2022 as an excuse to mess around with building web games using Rust.</p>
	<p>To play the game simply click it below and use the Arrow Keys!</p>

	<h1>How was this built?</h1>
	<p>After stumbling around in the dark for a few hours I found out about a small game engine for Rust called <a class=MidTextLink href="https://bevyengine.org">Bevy</a>. The main selling point for me was Bevy's ability to build for a WASM target natively. This made life MUCH easier than I expected.</p>
	<p>The only other tool I really needed (other than the standard Rust toolchain) was Trunk for handling building and running a small web server for testing.</p>
	<p>I have to stop writing this now but if you hit up <a class=MidTextLink href="https://github.com/brstrutt/Roll-of-the-Die">The Repo</a> you can see the source and there should be some basic build/run instructions if you want them.</p>
