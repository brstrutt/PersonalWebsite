## Description
This is the sourcecode for a small website i've hacked together with basically no experience.
It's currently hosted over at [benstrutt.space](https://benstrutt.space)

## Development
To develop using the devcontainer:
- Install `VSCode`
- Install `docker` and `docker-compose-plugin`
- Open the folder in VSCode
- Reopen folder in container, using the green button in the bottom left, or the notification in the bottom right
- The site should be available on `localhost:8080` and maybe `localhost:80`. A popup will also appear in VSCode when the devcontainer is opened with a button that opens the site
- If the database is empty you can open the Debug Page and click `Insert Posts To Database` to populate it
