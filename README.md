## Description
This is the sourcecode for a small website i've hacked together with basically no experience.
It's currently hosted over at [benstrutt.space](https://benstrutt.space)

## Development
To develop using the devcontainer:
- Install `VSCode`
- Install `docker` and `docker-compose-plugin`
- Open the folder in VSCode
- Reopen folder in container, using the green button in the bottom left, or the notification in the bottom right
- A popup should appear in the bottom right with an `open in browser` button, click this.
    - If this popup does not appear, run `apachectl start` to boot up the server. That should trigger the popup
